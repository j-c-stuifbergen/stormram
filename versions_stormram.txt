versions stormram.html
=======================

stormram_08.html
===================
- labels added
- the initial orientation has changed
- createStormram.update will call svgObject.project()
- C is calculated by the distances from A, B1 and B2
- B is calculated (interpolated between A and C)
- a check is performed: does the result satisfy the given distances
(R1,..,R5, AC,AB,BC,BD)
- added XYZ axis symbol

===================
stormram_09.html
===================
- function footOnAxis replaces axisPoint
- function find_vec replaces find_vecA, same function used for A and C
- error handling added if A or C can't be calulated

===================
stormram_10.html
===================
function solveB5 returns values of each iteration, not only the final result

pictures are in folder /pics
I have added drawings and a mathematical explanation using MathJax.js

===================
stormram_11.html
===================
I moved some functions to separate files in /js
And I added a form to change the parameters R1-R5.

Explanations and numerical details have been moved to stormram_explanation.html
stormram.html has become very short.

ready to upload to my web-site!

=============================
left to do:
=============================
- XYZ should rotate around its origin, not around the stormram
- svgAxis and svgTest are in the same frame, but can rotate independently. So there is a risk that the axis frame's orientation will be wrong.
